### Hi there 👋🏾

My name is Jason James and I'm currently an active student of the Engineering Specialization (Systems) postgraduate course at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (@ the Medellín site / Robledo campus). I'm Colombian of Caribbean descent and an eager learner fighting procrastination; with a particular interest in builing solutions that advocate the ideals of open source and the cost-efficiency of moving to the cloud.

🛠️ I’m currently working on all-things **Rust CLI tools**
🤓 I’m currently learning how to Architect solutions with the help of Azure's amazing set of services and other **Clouds, DevOps, Optimization, Rust, Data Engineering with both Rust and Python**
🤝🏾 I’m looking to collaborate on Open Source
🤔 I’m looking for help with **LLMs and Copilot AI Pair programming**
💬 Ask me about **Resilience, Transactional Analysis, Antar Mouna (Mindfulness), travelling, Seinfeld and Microsoft Azure (in that order)**
📫 Hit me up on **(https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjamesbr/)**, preferably
⚡ Fun fact: This is my 12th year for being a massive fan of British soaps **(...the ones on the Tele, of course)**
