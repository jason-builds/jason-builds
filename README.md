### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**jason-builds/jason-builds** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Architecting in Azure and other Clouds, DevOps, Optimization, Rust, Data Engineering with both Rust and Python
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Open Source
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with LLMs and Copilot AI Pair programming
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Resilience
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Hit me up on LinkedIn, preferably
- âš¡ Fun fact: This is my 12th year for being a massive fan of British soaps (...the ones on the Tele, of course)
