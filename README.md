### Hi there 👋🏾

My name is Jason James and I'm currently an active student of the Engineering Specialization (Systems) postgraduate course at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (@ the Medellín site / Robledo campus). I'm Colombian of Caribbean descent and an eager learner fighting procrastination; with a particular interest in builing solutions that advocate for the ideals of open source and the cost-efficiency of moving to the cloud.
