### Hi there 👋🏾

My name is Jason James and I'm currently an active student of the Engineering Specialization (Systems) postgraduate course at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (@ the Medellín site / Robledo campus). I'm Colombian of Caribbean descent and an eager learner fighting procrastination; with a particular interest in builing solutions that advocate the ideals of open source and the cost-efficiency of moving to the cloud.

🔭 I’m currently working on all-things ### Rust CLI tools
### 🌱 I’m currently learning Architecting in Azure and other Clouds, DevOps, Optimization, Rust, Data Engineering with both Rust and Python
### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Open Source
### 🤔 I’m looking for help with LLMs and Copilot AI Pair programming
### 💬 Ask me about Resilience, Transactional Analysis, Antar Mouna (Mindfulness), travelling, Seinfeld and Microsoft Azure (in that order)
### 📫 Hit me up on L[inkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjamesbr/), preferably
### ⚡ Fun fact: This is my 12th year for being a massive fan of British soaps (...the ones on the Tele, of course)
